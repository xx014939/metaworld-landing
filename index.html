            <p><strong>Your</strong>Meta.World</p>
            <p>YourMeta.World is a brand new Metaverse created by Naail El-Sawah as an entry into the Moralis 2022 Hackathon. YourMeta.World is a proof of concept for what is possible when the Metaverse is truly decentralised.</p>

            <h2>Founder</h2>
            <p>My name is Naail El-Sawah and I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the United Kingdom. I first began buying Crypto back in 2017 just as that years bull run was forming. At first my interest in Crypto was purely from an investment point of view, but I gradually became more interested in the technology behind the tokens I was investing in and their potential use cases.</p>
            <p>During my second year of university I interned at Zubr VR (among other places), and fell further in love with Virtual Reality technology. During the pandemic I began to work as a web developer, specialising in Ecommerce platforms such as Shopify.Â  Over the last year I have become fascinated with NFT's and their integration into 3DÂ digital worlds.</p>
            <p>When Mark Zuckerberg announced to the world that he was creating the "Metaverse", the Crypto community became flooded with projects proclaiming to the be the Metaverse of the future. We saw centralised, finite digital land sold at astonishingly high prices to those new to crypto who had enough funds. We saw the mass monetisation of low value projects which promised to offer holders "a place in the Metaverse". And we saw promising technologies of the future overhyped and overvalued in their infancies, in order to earn a quick buck.</p>
            <p>This was my motivation for YourMeta.World. I set out to create a project which offered some solutions to the problems I saw in todays Metaverse projects.</p>

        <div class="problem__container-header">Problem One - Land</div>
        <div class="problem__container-body">
            <p>Most Meteverse applications currently contain a finite amount of land, owned by a central authority and auctioned off in public and private "land sales" for extortionate amounts of money.</p>
            <p>This is precisely the opposite of what a decentralised, block chain based Metaverse is meant to be. The Metaverse should be a fundamentally decentralised digital landscape of creators and consumers, with no one entity controlling the flow of currency and/or assets.</p>

        <div class="problem__container-header">Problem Two - True Ownserhip & Cross Platform</div>
        <div class="problem__container-body">
            <p>The vast majority of NFT's that have flooded the market at present day, corner themselves off as exclusive groups which offer exclusive benefits to their holders. Whilst it's understandable that the NFT's must have a unique selling point in order for them to be a suitable investment proposition, currently they are only usable in a specific area of the digital world.</p>
            <p>This goes against the idea of a user truly owning their NFT, as they can only interact with it a finite space under finite conditions. This once again is the complete opposite of what a block chain based Metaverse should be. Users should be allowed to display, wear, modify and combine their NFT's in any way they see fit inside of one (or many) digital places.</p>
            <p>They should be able to interact with their NFT's in 3D or 2D, in AR or VR or not.</p>

        <div class="problem__container-header">Problem Two - Lack of Innovation & Tools</div>
        <div class="problem__container-body">
            <p>Perhaps most frustratingly, many NFT collections being released nowadays are very often just copy cat projects with art work that follows whatever the latest crypto meme is. These projects fail to use their considerable funds and popularity to invest in technological innovation in the Crypto space, and instead offer holders nothing more than "The best community" and a 2D piece of artwork, with promises of an exclusive digital space in Decentraland one day.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The NFT space will eventually evolve into something far greater then it currently is, however as of right now there is a severe lack in NFT tools which encourage exciting innovation and use cases among NFT creators and developers.</p>

                <h2>Land</h2>
                <p>Your Meta World views land as an infinite resource, which every wallet should be allowed to share in. Every user will have their own plot of free land which they will own forever</p>
                <p>Every user will have their own freely expandable piece of the Metaverse, thus making buying/selling land plots redundant and removing the concept of land sales from this Metaverse.</p>

                <p>Users can wear, display, wrap (around 3D objects) and touch their NFT's for the first time in their own VR traversable and expandable digital land.</p>

                <p>Your Meta World hopes to offer a large range of free innovative services available to its users in the near future. At present we are able to offer the worlds first 3D GLTF NFT lazy minter.</p>
                <p>This minter allows users to upload 3D GLTF files to the IPFS network, and then dynamically load these NFT's into a 3D VR traversable environment within which they can then interact with them as if they were real objects!</p>
